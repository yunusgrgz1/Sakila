### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Analysis and Segmentation ** 
- In this scenario, our marketing team requested a list of the top 10 customers who have spent the most. These customers will be categorized as premium customers and offered exclusive opportunities.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, SUM(p.amount) AS total_amount
FROM customer c 
JOIN payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
order by total_amount desc
LIMIT 10;
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Developing a Recommendation System **

- We are providing 5 recommended films from each of the top three categories most rented by a customer, ensuring that these films have not been rented by the customer before.

```sql

    -- The 3 categories most rented by the customer
    SELECT 
        c.name AS category,
        COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
    FROM rental r
    JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
    JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id
    JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
    JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
    WHERE r.customer_id = 1  
    GROUP BY c.name
    ORDER BY rental_count DESC
    LIMIT 3  -- En √ßok kiralanan 3 kategori

        WHERE r.customer_id = 1  -- Exclude the films that Customer 1 has previously rented.
    )
)
-- 3. Filter the results and recommend only 5 films from each category.
SELECT recommended_film, category

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Stored Procedure ve Trigger ** 

- We realized that we frequently need to learn the most popular category for many customers, so we are creating a **Stored Procedure** function specifically for this purpose

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE GetMostPopularCategory (IN p_customer_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT c.name AS category
    FROM category c
    JOIN film_category fc ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
    JOIN film f ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
    JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
    JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
    WHERE r.customer_id = p_customer_id
    GROUP BY c.name
    ORDER BY COUNT(r.rental_id) DESC
    LIMIT 1;
END$$
```

- ≈ûimdi bu prosed√ºr√º 1 numralƒ± m√º≈üteri i√ßin √ßaƒüƒ±rƒ±yoruz
  
```sql
CALL GetMostPopularCategory(1);
```
- Answer

|category|
|--------|
|Classics|

- Each customer can rent a maximum of 10 films per year, so we want to create a trigger to detect customers who exceed this limit.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER CheckRentalLimit
AFTER INSERT ON rental
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DECLARE rental_count INT;
    DECLARE rental_limit INT DEFAULT 10; -- Limit

    -- We count the rentals made by the user within a specific date range.
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO rental_count
    FROM rental
    WHERE customer_id = NEW.customer_id
      AND rental_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'; -- Example date range for the year 2005. 

    -- If the rental count exceeds the limit, we add a record to the rental_history table.
    IF rental_count > rental_limit THEN
        INSERT INTO rental_history (customer_id, rental_id, message)
        VALUES (NEW.customer_id, NEW.rental_id, 'Rental limit exceeded!');
    END IF;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```


- The End
